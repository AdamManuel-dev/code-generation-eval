# Local AI Code Quality Evaluation System
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 1. Purpose and Background

AI-generated code can accelerate development, but it often comes with unpredictable quality issues – from subtle bugs to inconsistent style. Ensuring such code meets high standards requires rigorous automated checks. This PRD outlines a local testing system to evaluate Node.js/TypeScript projects (especially those generated by AI) for quality and correctness without relying on any external CI service. Running entirely on a developer's machine, this tool will act as a "quality gate" for generated code before integration.

By focusing on deterministic static analysis (like compilation and linting) and offering an optional AI-driven review, the system catches issues early and consistently. Industry guidance suggests that AI-written code should be subjected to robust linting and static analysis pipelines to detect syntax errors, style inconsistencies, and potential bugs as early as possible. The goal of this product is to automate such analyses locally, providing quick feedback on code quality and freeing human reviewers to focus on deeper logic and design concerns.

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

The local testing system must fulfill the following functional requirements:

### 2.1 Local CLI Input
Accept a path to a Node.js/TypeScript project directory as input (e.g. via a CLI command). The tool will scan this directory for source code, configuration files (like package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.), tests, and schema definitions.

### 2.2 Deterministic Quality Checks
Perform a series of automated quality evaluations on the project in multiple categories (detailed in the next section). These include strict TypeScript compilation, ESLint/Prettier linting, test execution with coverage, API response schema validation, and custom runtime behavior tests. Each check produces a pass/fail result and a score or metric.

### 2.3 Optional LLM Review
Optionally, run an AI (LLM) based code review step to assess code quality in a more subjective manner. This step can be toggled by the user (off by default unless configured, since it may require additional resources or an API key).

### 2.4 Aggregated Report
Compile the results of all checks into a comprehensive output – primarily a JSON report (details below) containing pass/fail status and numerical scores per category. The tool should also print a human-readable summary to the console for quick review (for example, which categories passed or failed).

### 2.5 Configuration & Thresholds
Allow configuration of certain parameters via flags or config file:
- Ability to enable/disable specific categories of checks (e.g. skip test coverage or skip LLM review).
- Set thresholds for passing (e.g. minimum test coverage percentage required, or schema compliance level).
- Provide path to specific config files if needed (for example, a custom ESLint config, or an OpenAPI spec file location if not auto-detected).

### 2.6 Scoring Methodology
Define a scoring system for each category and an overall score. For instance, each quality category could contribute to an overall 0–100 score, or simply each be scored 0–10 points. This allows users to gauge overall quality at a glance in addition to per-category results.

### 2.7 Failure Handling
If critical steps fail (for example, the project fails to compile at all), the tool should report that failure and gracefully continue to other checks where possible. (E.g., if compilation fails, tests might be skipped, but linting could still run to provide feedback.) The system should clearly indicate any steps that were skipped due to prior failures.

### 2.8 Security and Privacy
Do not send any code or data to external servers. All analysis (except the optional LLM call) must occur locally. If the LLM review is enabled and requires an API (e.g. OpenAI), the user must explicitly provide an API key or configure a local model – by default, no network calls are made. Running untrusted generated code (during tests or runtime checks) should be sandboxed as much as possible to avoid harming the host system.

### 2.9 Extensible Design
The system should be built so that new checks or support for other project types can be added with minimal changes (see Extensibility below). This implies a modular architecture where each evaluation category is implemented as a component or plugin.

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Offline Operation
The tool must run entirely locally, without requiring internet connectivity or CI services. All primary analyses use local compilers and libraries. (The only exception is the optional LLM review, which can be configured to use a local model or require an API – but by default, it's not needed for core functionality.)

### 3.2 Performance
The system should provide results in a reasonable time. For a medium-sized project (e.g. a few hundred TypeScript files and a moderate test suite), the analysis should complete in minutes, not hours. Each category's checks should be optimized (e.g. running lint and tests in parallel if possible). If certain checks are extremely slow, they should be optionally skippable or run at a lower priority.

### 3.3 Deterministic Outputs
The deterministic checks (compilation, lint, tests, etc.) should produce consistent results on each run given the same code. The LLM-based check may produce slightly varying feedback, but its influence on scoring should be optional or averaged to avoid unpredictability.

### 3.4 Usability
The CLI interface and outputs should be user-friendly. Results should be clearly organized by category. The JSON report format should be well-documented so that it can be consumed by other tools or scripts if needed. Console output (if any) should highlight failures and important warnings in a readable way (e.g. colored output for pass/fail).

### 3.5 Platform Compatibility
The tool should work on major OS platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) as it will be used by developers locally. It should rely on widely available Node.js tooling and not assume OS-specific features.

### 3.6 Robustness
The system should handle error cases gracefully – for example, if the user points it at a non-Node project or a directory without tests, it should handle the absence of expected files in a controlled manner (reporting "No tests found" rather than crashing). All file I/O and subprocess executions (for running compilers, linters, etc.) should be wrapped with error handling.

### 3.7 Maintainability
The codebase of this tool should be modular and well-documented, allowing other developers (or future contributors) to update rules, upgrade underlying tools (like newer ESLint or TypeScript versions), or add new features. It should follow good development practices (maybe even dogfooding its own lint rules on itself).

---

## 4. Evaluation Categories and Scoring

Below are the quality evaluation categories the system will cover, each with its purpose, methodology, and scoring criteria. Each category yields a pass/fail result and contributes to an overall quality score. By default, all categories are enabled, but the user can opt to skip certain checks via CLI flags if not applicable.

### 4.1 Compilation (TypeScript Strict Mode)

**Purpose:** Ensure the project's TypeScript code compiles without errors under the strictest type-checking settings. This catches type mismatches, undeclared variables, and other issues that could lead to runtime errors. The TypeScript compiler's strict flag "enables a wide range of type checking behavior that results in stronger guarantees of program correctness", so this check enforces the highest level of type safety.

**Method:** The tool will attempt to compile the project using tsc (TypeScript compiler) with --strict mode enabled (if not already enabled in the project's tsconfig). It will either use the project's own tsconfig.json (ensuring that all strict options are true) or generate one on the fly for the check. All TypeScript errors will be collected.

- If any compile errors are present, this category is failed. The output report will include the error count and possibly a summary of the first few errors for convenience.
- If compilation succeeds with 0 errors, the category is passed. (Warnings are generally not an issue in TypeScript; it's either errors or nothing in strict mode.)

**Scoring:** This category could contribute, for example, 20% of the overall score. A simple pass could yield full points (e.g. 10/10), whereas a fail yields 0. (Optionally, we might deduct partial points if there are only minor errors or if strict mode wasn't initially enabled – but a simpler approach is binary scoring here.) In practice, any compilation error is critical, so in the default scoring model, a fail here might even zero out the overall score or block further testing. The tool will still attempt subsequent checks, but the final verdict will note that compilation must be fixed.

### 4.2 Linting & Formatting (ESLint and Prettier)

**Purpose:** Enforce code style and best practices by linting the code and checking formatting. Linters can catch potential bugs (like unused variables or risky code patterns) and ensure consistency in coding style, while a formatter ensures the codebase has a uniform style (which improves readability and maintainability across AI-generated code). As the ESLint documentation states, ESLint "statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems" without running it. Prettier, on the other hand, is an "opinionated code formatter" that keeps code style consistent and easy to read across the team.

**Method:** The system will run ESLint on the project source (respecting any existing .eslintrc configuration in the project, or using a default recommended configuration if none is present). It will also run Prettier (in --check mode) on all relevant files to ensure they are properly formatted according to either the project's Prettier config or default style rules.

- For ESLint: Any rule violations reported at error level will cause a linting failure. The tool will count the number of errors (and possibly warnings) and include them in the report. ESLint can also automatically fix many issues; however, this tool is in evaluation mode, so it will not modify the code – just report issues. (Optionally, we could allow an auto-fix mode as a separate command, but by default it's read-only.)
- For Prettier: If any file is not correctly formatted (i.e., Prettier's check fails), that will count as a formatting issue. The tool will list files that need formatting. Consistent formatting is important to avoid "bikeshedding" on style and to make the code easier to review.

**Scoring:** This category can contribute to the overall score based on the proportion of lint/format issues. For example, it might have 10 points total – losing 1 point for each serious lint error (up to -10), and perhaps minor deduction for numerous minor warnings or formatting fixes needed. A perfectly linted and formatted project yields full points. If there are just a few minor issues, partial points might be awarded. In the JSON output, we will include the count of ESLint errors (and warnings) and whether formatting passed or not. A pass means zero ESLint errors and no formatting issues; anything else is a fail for this category (with the score indicating how far off it was). This enforcement aligns with the idea that linting tools like ESLint let developers "discover problems with their code without executing it" (e.g. catching undefined vars, improper async usage, etc.), and Prettier ensures no inconsistencies slip through in code style.

### 4.3 Testing & Coverage

**Purpose:** Verify that the project's automated tests run successfully and measure how much of the code is covered by tests. High test coverage doesn't guarantee bug-free code, but it increases confidence that more of the code's paths have been exercised, reducing the risk of undetected bugs. This is especially important for AI-generated code, which may have subtle bugs – a robust test suite can catch regressions or logical errors. The evaluation here has two parts: test outcomes (pass/fail) and code coverage percentage.

**Method:** The system will detect and run the project's tests. By default, it will look for a test runner like Jest or Vitest:

- If the project has a package.json with scripts like test, or dependencies on Jest/Vitest, the tool will use those. For example, running npm test or an equivalent programmatic API to execute tests.
- Tests are run in a child process or via the testing framework's API, capturing results. The tool will collect whether tests passed (all assertions green) or if any failed.

For coverage, the tool will integrate with the test runner to collect coverage metrics:

- For Jest, it can enable --coverage and get a coverage summary (often Jest outputs a JSON summary or lcov report). For Vitest, a coverage plugin can produce similar results.
- If no built-in coverage is available, the tool could instrument the code with Istanbul (NYC) or use Node's --experimental-test-coverage for its test runner. Utilizing coverage tools like Istanbul helps automate measuring which lines/branches were executed.
- After tests run, the tool will extract the overall coverage percentage (and possibly per-category coverage like lines, branches, functions – but for scoring we mainly use overall line or statement coverage).

**Scoring:** This category can be split into Test Results and Coverage:

- Test Results: If any tests fail (i.e., the test suite exits with failures), this category is a fail (and likely a severe one). Score might be 0 in that case since the code doesn't meet its own specified functionality. If all tests pass, then scoring depends on coverage.
- Coverage Percentage: We define a threshold (for example, 80% line coverage as a default minimum). If the coverage is at or above the threshold, full points for coverage. If below, the score could be proportional. For instance, if coverage is 60% and threshold 80%, the project might get 7.5/10 points for this category (just as an example). Very low coverage (or no tests at all) would result in a fail for this category and 0 points, since lack of tests means low confidence in the code's reliability.

The JSON report will include the numeric coverage percentage and whether it met the required threshold (pass/fail), as well as the number of tests passed/failed. We'll also allow configuring the coverage threshold per project if needed.

### 4.4 Response Schema Validation (Zod/OpenAPI Conformity)

**Purpose:** Ensure that any API responses or data outputs produced by the project conform to an expected schema or contract. In AI-generated server code, there might be predefined schemas (e.g. using Zod for runtime validation or an OpenAPI specification for REST APIs). This check verifies that the code actually adheres to those schemas. By validating responses against a schema, we catch mismatches early – for example, missing fields or wrong data types – that could otherwise cause client integration issues. Using Zod or JSON schema for validation can automate what would be tedious manual checking.

**Method:** The tool will look for the presence of:

- **Zod Schemas:** If the project uses Zod (a TypeScript-friendly schema validation library), there might be schema definitions for inputs/outputs. The tool can locate Zod schemas (for example, by scanning for z.object({...}) definitions or by convention files) and identify how they relate to function outputs or API routes.
- **OpenAPI/Swagger Spec:** If an OpenAPI spec (openapi.yaml or swagger.json) is present, that provides a contract for each API endpoint's response structure.

The validation process can take a couple of approaches:

- **Static conformance:** Compare TypeScript types or interfaces used in the code against the schema definitions. For instance, if there's an OpenAPI spec, the tool can generate TypeScript types from it (using libraries like openapi-typescript or zod-openapi) and check if the actual response types (perhaps inferred from the code or tests) match those.
- **Dynamic testing:** Launch the application (if it's a server) in a test mode and perform sample requests to each API endpoint, then validate the actual JSON responses against the expected schema (using Zod parsing or a JSON Schema validator like Ajv). Similarly, for library code, the tool could call exported functions with sample inputs (if available or via example tests) and validate their outputs.

For example, if there's a Zod schema UserSchema defining the shape of a user profile object, and the code has an endpoint /user/profile, the tool can call that endpoint (or invoke the handler function directly) and then do UserSchema.safeParse(response) to ensure it passes. As described in an approach with Playwright tests, automating schema validation ensures responses always conform to expected structures, catching mismatches before they break things.

- If mismatches are found (e.g., the response is missing a required field or has an incorrect type), those are reported as schema violations.
- If all checked outputs match their schemas, the category is passed.

**Scoring:** This could be a smaller portion of the score (say 10% of total), but quite important for API projects. A pass yields full points. Failing this means the code is not fulfilling its specified contract – likely a critical issue – so we'd give 0 points if any major schema violation is found. (If multiple endpoints are checked, we might deduct partial points per failing endpoint.) The report will list which endpoints or functions failed schema checks and details of the mismatch (e.g., "expected property age: number but got age: string in response from GET /user/profile").

This category may be skipped (or not applicable) if the project does not define any schemas or API contracts. The tool should detect that scenario. If skipped (because no schema is provided), it could either not appear in the score or appear as N/A (and not count towards total score). Alternatively, we could treat absence of any schema definition as a warning (since ideally projects should have some contract), but that goes into subjective territory. In any case, the system is ready to leverage schemas if they exist.

### 4.5 File System & Runtime Behavior Checks (Watchers and Concurrency)

**Purpose:** Go beyond static analysis and tests to examine certain runtime characteristics of the code. Specifically, this category will cover:

- **File-system watchers behavior:** If the project includes functionality like watching files or directories for changes (common in CLI tools, dev servers, or certain libraries), we want to ensure these watchers respond correctly and efficiently.
- **Race condition simulation:** Try to catch concurrency issues by simulating race conditions or parallel operations in the code. While Node.js is single-threaded, race conditions can still occur in asynchronous code (e.g., two async operations on the same resource interleaving unpredictably).

AI-generated code might introduce subtle timing or state bugs; for example, missing debouncing on file watchers or not handling simultaneous requests properly. This category attempts to surface such issues.

**Method:**

**Watcher Responsiveness:** The tool will scan the code for usage of file watchers (e.g., fs.watch, chokidar, or similar APIs). If present, we perform a targeted test:

- Launch the part of the application that sets up the watcher (this might be an explicit function or a dev script). Possibly, the tool can import the module that starts watchers or run npm run start in a special mode.
- Simulate a file change event. For example, create or modify a temporary file that the watcher is observing.
- Measure the tool's reaction: Did it trigger the expected callback? If the code logs something or updates something on file change, the tool can monitor the output or a certain variable.
- We may also measure the latency between the file change and the response (to ensure it's prompt). However, due to environment differences, we might just ensure it does respond within a short time (a few seconds at most).
- If the watcher fails to respond or has issues (like crashes on file change, or doesn't detect the change), that's a problem. We mark this as a failure of the watcher check. (If the project has multiple watchers, test each if possible.)

**Race Conditions and Concurrency:** We use a combination of static and dynamic strategies:

- **Static analysis for shared state:** Using ESLint rules or custom analysis to detect patterns like global variables or mutable state that's accessed in multiple places. (For instance, a rule to flag non-constant globals or usage of certain Node APIs that are known to be tricky in concurrent scenarios.) ESLint can help catch shared mutable state which often causes race conditions.
- **Parallel test execution:** If the project has tests, we can attempt to run tests in parallel to see if any tests start failing when not run sequentially. For example, run jest with --runInBand=false (enabling parallel workers). If tests are well-isolated, they should pass even in parallel; if not, failures might indicate race conditions or shared state issues. Similarly, running the test suite multiple times in a loop (say 10-20 times) can catch flaky tests that may fail intermittently due to timing issues.
- **Custom stress tests:** For certain critical functions, the tool might spawn multiple concurrent calls (using Promise.all or worker threads) to see if outcomes differ or if any uncaught exceptions occur. For example, if there's a function writing to a file, call it 100 times in parallel and verify the final file content is consistent or at least no errors were thrown. This can catch issues like missing locks or improper use of async APIs.
- **Simulated delays:** Another technique is to monkey-patch or instrument the code to insert small delays or out-of-order execution in asynchronous calls to see if it breaks assumptions (more advanced, perhaps for future implementation).

Given the complexity, not all projects will have easily testable concurrency aspects, but if any issues are detected by these methods, they will be reported.

**Scoring:** This category is somewhat binary – either a serious issue is found or not:

- If watchers are present and one fails to respond properly, that results in a fail for this category (score 0 for this part).
- If a race condition or flaky concurrent behavior is detected (e.g., tests that fail when run in parallel), that's also a fail. Intermittent issues would be noted (e.g., "Test X is flaky under repeated runs").
- If none of the above issues are found, the category is passed and full points are awarded.

This category might be weighted less (say 10% of total) because it's more specialized. However, any detected issue here can be critical to reliability. The output will include details, for example: "File watcher on src/utils/fsWatcher.ts did not trigger on file change" or "Global variable cache causes race conditions (parallel test failures in test XYZ)". If no watchers or concurrency features are in the project, this category could be marked as not applicable or simply give full points by default (since there was nothing to test, by definition no issues found).

### 4.6 LLM-Based Code Quality Review (Optional)

**Purpose:** Provide a higher-level, qualitative assessment of the code using a Large Language Model. Deterministic tools can catch specific bugs and style issues, but an LLM (like GPT-4 or Code Llama) can offer insights on code readability, maintainability, and possible refactoring improvements by understanding the code in a more holistic way. This is particularly useful for AI-generated code, which might be logically correct but written in an odd or non-idiomatic style. An LLM can flag things like "this function is very long – maybe it should be broken up" or "these variable names are confusing," etc., which static linters might not fully capture.

**Method:** If enabled, the system will either call out to an AI API (like OpenAI's GPT) or use a local LLM model to review the code. The process:

- Prepare a prompt that includes representative snippets of the code or a summary of the project structure. (Since sending the entire project might be too large, the tool could focus on key files like the largest files, or it could iterate through files asking for issues.)
- Ask the LLM for a code review focusing on certain aspects: clarity, potential bugs, adherence to best practices, dead code, etc. The prompt might say, for example: "You are an expert software reviewer. Analyze the following TypeScript project and identify any potential issues or areas of improvement in terms of code quality, architecture, and style. Be specific in your feedback."
- The LLM's response is then captured. We'll parse it for any critical issues or themes. For instance, if it points out a possible bug ("function X might not handle Y case") or a security concern, that's noteworthy.

Given this is optional and potentially non-deterministic, the LLM's feedback will not be able to fail the project in a strict sense (since it could occasionally be wrong). Instead, this category will provide a subjective score or rating and some commentary:

- We might map certain sentiments to a score (e.g., if the LLM says the code is excellent with only minor nitpicks, that's a high score; if it identifies multiple serious issues, that's a low score).
- The LLM's comments will be summarized and included in the report, but likely marked as advisory. For example: "LLM Review: The code is generally well-structured, but the function calculatePayment is very complex (100+ lines) and could be broken into smaller functions. It also noted a potential edge case in parseData() regarding null inputs." This aligns with capabilities of models like Code Llama, which can do in-depth code reviews, pointing out optimizations and code smells.

**Scoring:** Since this is optional, it might not contribute to the main 100% score unless enabled. If enabled and used, it could be a bonus category or simply reported separately. If we were to score it, it could be something like:

- 10/10 if the LLM finds no significant issues and praises code quality.
- 5/10 if it finds a few moderate issues.
- 0/10 if it flags serious concerns (like "the code is difficult to maintain or likely buggy in areas").

However, to avoid confusion, we might keep LLM feedback out of the numeric scoring by default and label it as a qualitative grade (e.g., "LLM Assessment: Good/Fair/Poor"). This prevents an unstable AI output from affecting the overall deterministic score. Users can read the feedback and decide how to act on it. The PRD includes it because it's a requested feature – providing that extra layer of insight that static tools might miss.

## 5. Scoring Methodology

Each category above contributes to an overall score that reflects the project's quality. The default scoring methodology is as follows:

- **Compilation:** Critical must-pass category. Worth 10 points. If compilation fails, score 0 here (and effectively the project cannot be considered passing overall). If it passes, 10 points.
- **Linting & Formatting:** Worth 10 points. Full 10 if no lint errors and code is properly formatted. Deduct points for each error or a threshold of errors. (E.g., >0 errors might automatically be, say, 5/10, with more than 10 errors 0/10 – specifics to be determined, but the idea is that any significant lint issues heavily impact the score). Minor formatting issues might knock a point or two off.
- **Testing & Coverage:** Worth 10 points. This could be split: 5 points for tests passing, 5 for coverage. If tests fail, 0 for this whole category. If tests pass but coverage is below threshold, the 5 coverage points are prorated (e.g., if coverage target is 80% but actual is 60%, that's 0/5 for coverage since it's too low or perhaps 60/80 of 5 points = 3.75). If tests pass and meet coverage, full 10.
- **Schema Validation:** Worth 10 points. Full 10 if all applicable schemas/contract checks pass. If any endpoint or data schema fails, 0 for this category (or if multiple endpoints, could do partial, e.g., 2 schemas passed and 1 failed out of 3, give 3/10 – but simpler is pass=10, fail=0 because one contract breach is critical).
- **Runtime Behavior:** Worth 10 points. Full 10 if no issues. If a watcher fails or a race condition found, 0 for this category (or maybe 5 if one sub-issue found and 2 if multiple issues – but likely treat any major issue as fail).
- **LLM Review:** (Optional) If included in scoring, could be 10 points, assigned based on the AI's general code quality impression. If not included, it doesn't affect the 50-point base from above categories. If included, the total score might be out of 60 points (which could be normalized to percentage). We will clearly indicate whether the LLM review influenced the numeric score or is just advisory.

So, excluding LLM by default, the core deterministic checks contribute up to 50 points (or 100%). In the final JSON, we will likely output both the raw points and a normalized percentage for convenience. For example, a project might score 42/50 = 84%. If LLM is used as a 6th category, it could be 52/60 = 86.7%, etc.

Furthermore, each category will have a "passed": true/false in the JSON. The tool may also designate an overall pass/fail based on critical criteria (for instance, we might require certain key categories to pass for overall pass: e.g., it must compile, have no lint errors, and tests must pass for an overall "PASS"). These criteria can be configured. By default, overall fail if compilation or tests fail; otherwise it's up to the user's interpretation of scores.

The scoring methodology should be transparent and configurable. We will document how each category's score is calculated and allow adjusting weights if needed via a config file.

## 6. CLI and User Experience Design

The system will be accessible through a Command Line Interface as a Node.js CLI tool (installable via npm). The user interface and flow will be:

### 6.1 Installation
Users can install globally (e.g., npm install -g aiq-quality-tester) or use it via npx. The CLI name might be something like aiqtest or proj-eval. (Exact naming TBD.)

### 6.2 Usage
Running the tool on a project:

```bash
aiqtest ./my-generated-project --output report.json --enable-llm
```

This would point the tool at the my-generated-project directory. By default, it will look for all standard files in that directory (assuming it's the root of the Node.js project).

### 6.3 Command-line Options
- `--output <file>` to specify an output JSON file path. If not given, it will print the JSON to stdout or save to a default (like quality-report.json in the project).
- `--format json|text` to choose output format. json (default) produces the detailed JSON report. A text format could produce a human-friendly summary (similar to how some linters or test runners output results).
- `--categories <list>` to limit or specify which checks to run. For example, `--categories compile,lint,tests` would only run those three, skipping schema, runtime, and LLM checks. Conversely, `--skip <list>` could exclude certain categories.
- `--llm` or `--enable-llm` (with maybe a model choice or API key parameter) to run the LLM review. We might allow specifying `--openai-api-key <key>` or point to a config file for LLM settings. Alternatively, if a local model is configured, something like `--llm-model codellama` could trigger that.
- `--coverage-threshold <percent>` to override the default 80% coverage requirement.
- `--schema <path>` if the OpenAPI schema is not in a standard location or to explicitly provide a schema file.
- `--verbose` to output more details to console (like full lint error list, or all test output). By default, the console output will be minimal (since details are in JSON).

### 6.4 Output Display
In the console, the tool will show a brief summary table or list of each category with PASS/FAIL and score, so the developer can quickly see what failed.

For example:

```
Compilation: PASS (10/10)
Linting: FAIL (8/10) – 2 ESLint errors, 5 files need formatting
Tests: PASS (10/10) – 120 tests passed, coverage 82%
Schema: PASS (10/10)
Runtime: PASS (10/10)
LLM Review: (skipped)

Overall: 48/50 (96%) – QUALITY OK
```

And it might color-code "FAIL" in red, "PASS" in green, etc., for visibility.

- If `--format json` is specified (or by default if run in CI script mode), the JSON is output (and the console summary might be suppressed unless `--verbose`).
- If an output file is specified, the JSON is written to that file. The console will still show a short message like "Quality report generated: 4 categories passed, 1 failed (see report.json for details)."

### 6.5 JSON Report Structure
The JSON will have a top-level structure indicating each category's outcomes and scores, as well as an overall assessment. (Detailed format in the next section.)

### 6.6 Failure Cases
If the tool itself encounters an error (e.g., it can't find the project path, or a sub-process crashes), it will exit with a non-zero exit code and an error message. If the project fails certain checks, the tool's exit code can be configurable – e.g., an option `--strict-exit-code` could make the CLI exit with code 1 if any category failed (useful for automation or CI usage in the future), whereas by default it might always exit 0 (since the presence of the report is the output, not pass/fail enforcement). For local usage, we might not want to throw an error code for quality issues, just report them.

### 6.7 Help and Documentation
Running `aiqtest --help` will show usage instructions and list all options. The PRD won't detail every help text, but the CLI will follow standard conventions.

### 6.8 User Experience Example
A developer uses an AI code generator to scaffold a new project. They run our tool:

```bash
$ aiqtest myproj --llm --output quality.json
```

The tool prints:

```
Running AI Code Quality Evaluation on 'myproj'...
[1/6] 🔍 Compiling TypeScript (strict mode)...
[2/6] 🔍 Linting and Formatting...
[3/6] 🔍 Running Tests with coverage...
[4/6] 🔍 Validating API schema...
[5/6] 🔍 Simulating runtime behaviors...
[6/6] 🔍 LLM Code Review (Code Llama)...
✅ Compilation passed.
⚠️ Linting issues found (see report).
✅ All tests passed (coverage 85%).
✅ Schema validation passed.
✅ Runtime checks passed.
(Llm Review) Code quality is decent, but see suggestions in report.

Overall: 4/5 checks passed. See quality.json for full details.
```

(The above is illustrative. The actual text/icons may differ, but the idea is to inform the user of progress and outcomes in a friendly way.)

The quality.json would contain the detailed breakdown for each step.

## 7. Output Format

The primary output is a JSON report summarizing all evaluation results. This report is meant to be both human-readable (with clear fields) and machine-readable (so it can be parsed by other tools or CI pipelines if needed).

### 7.1 JSON Structure (Draft)

### 7.2 Notes on Structure
- **project:** Name or identifier of the project (maybe derived from folder name or package.json name).
- **overall:** An aggregate section:
  - `passed` could indicate if the project meets an overall pass criteria. In this example, it's false because one category (Linting) failed. What constitutes overall "pass" might be configurable.
  - `score` and `maxScore`: the total points obtained vs possible. Here 48/50.
  - `percentage`: just a convenience (score/maxScore*100).
  - `criticalFailures`: list of any categories that were considered critical fails (so the user knows what to fix first).
- **categories:** An array where each element corresponds to a category checked. Each has:
  - `name`: a string identifier (could be CamelCase or human-readable).
  - `passed`: boolean (or null if not applicable). null in LLMReview indicates that "pass/fail" is not applicable for a subjective review.
  - `score` and `maxScore`: numeric values (or null if not used for that category).
  - `details`: an object containing category-specific data:
    - For compilation: number of errors/warnings, maybe an array of error messages (not shown above to keep it short).
    - For linting: counts of ESLint errors, warnings, Prettier issues, plus maybe an example list of errors (the first N errors) and files that failed formatting.
    - For testing: counts of tests and coverage metrics.
    - For schema: how many schemas checked, and list of violations (if any) perhaps with endpoint names or schema names.
    - For runtime: how many watcher tests run and any issues (e.g. which watcher didn't respond), how many race condition tests and if any found (could list specific problematic functions or tests).
    - For LLM: since no numeric score, we give a summary and a list of detailed findings as reported by the AI. This is basically the AI's feedback. This could be quite verbose, so we include what we can. Possibly the raw LLM response could be saved to a separate text file, with only summary in JSON.

The actual JSON will be tailored to ensure it's not overly large if many issues — e.g., we might limit lists to a certain number of entries or allow a verbosity setting.

### 7.3 Output Extensibility
If new categories are added in the future, they would just appear as additional entries in the categories array, with their own detail schema. Tools reading this JSON should ideally not break if an unknown category appears (they can just ignore what they don't understand).

This JSON format allows the user or other tools to parse:
- One could write a script to fail a CI build if "overall.passed": false or if overall.percentage < someValue.
- The detailed info helps developers pinpoint issues (like exactly which files have lint errors, or what the LLM suggested).

The PRD's example is illustrative; actual field names might be tweaked for consistency (e.g., use snake_case or camelCase uniformly, etc.). Documentation will accompany the tool to explain each field.

---

## 8. Extensibility

### 8.1 Design for Extensibility
The system is designed to easily incorporate new rules, categories, or even support other project types (beyond Node/TS) in the future. Key strategies for extensibility:

### 8.2 Modular Architecture
Each evaluation category will be implemented as a separate module or class with a common interface (e.g., a runCheck(projectPath) -> result function). The main orchestrator will simply call each enabled module in sequence. This means adding a new check is as simple as writing a new module that implements the interface and adding it to the pipeline (and to the report schema).

### 8.3 Plugin System
We can allow the tool to load custom checks from a plugins directory or NPM packages. For example, a user could write a plugin that checks for security vulnerabilities (using npm audit or static analysis for secrets) and drop it in a .aiqtest/plugins folder, and the tool would run it as an additional category. The PRD doesn't require implementing a full plugin ecosystem in v1, but we will design the core in a way that's amenable to this. For instance, configuration could list additional scripts or commands to run as part of the evaluation.

### 8.4 Configuration for Rules
The tool will respect standard config files for the underlying tools (tsconfig, .eslintrc, .prettierrc, jest config, etc.). In addition, we can have our own config (like aiqtest.config.json) where one can:

- Enable/disable categories globally.
- Set scoring weights or pass thresholds.
- Provide file globs to include/exclude for certain checks (e.g., maybe skip linting on a generated SDK folder).
- Map out how to start the server for schema tests if needed (like a script name).
- Provide custom LLM prompt or model settings.

This makes the tool flexible for different project needs without changing code.

### 8.5 Extending to Other Languages/Frameworks
Although this PRD is Node.js/TypeScript specific, the concept could extend to other project types (Python, Java, etc.). With extensibility in mind, we isolate Node-specific logic. For example, the compilation module is obviously TS-centric, but it could be swapped out or extended for other compilers. Linting is ESLint now, but we could later support pylint for Python if needed, etc. Perhaps in the codebase, we'll separate a core framework (managing running checks and aggregating results) from the language-specific check implementations. In future, one might invoke pyqtest for a Python project with analogous checks.

### 8.6 Updating Rules and Tools
As best practices evolve, we might want to add new ESLint rules or change thresholds. Because the system is local, developers can update it frequently (we can version it and release updates). We'll also allow easy updating of the underlying tool versions: e.g., TypeScript or ESLint can be upgraded and the tool should still work (or we may allow it to use the project's local ESLint version to avoid version mismatches).

### 8.7 New Quality Categories
The design allows introduction of new categories such as:

- **Security Analysis:** e.g., scanning for known vulnerabilities (using Node audit or tools like SonarQube or OWASP dependency check).
- **Performance Profiling:** perhaps running some profiling or checking bundle sizes for front-end code.
- **Dependency health:** checking outdated packages or license compliance.

Those could be plugins or built-in in future versions. The scoring system can scale to include them (we'd adjust maxScore or weighting accordingly, or they remain separate advisory categories).

In summary, by making each check loosely coupled and configurable, the product will not be a static one-off tool but a flexible framework for code quality checks. This is crucial because as AI-generated code becomes more prevalent, new types of checks (or new AI techniques) will emerge – we want to be able to integrate those without a rewrite.

For instance, if a new AI model comes out that can automatically generate additional test cases, we could add a module for "AI-generated additional testing" as a category. Or if supporting a new file type, we add a lint rule for it. The core remains the orchestrator and report aggregator.

---

## 9. Architecture and Implementation Plan

### 9.1 Architecture Overview
The system will be implemented in Node.js (so it can easily interface with the Node/TS tools). The core components:

- **Main CLI Module:** Parses CLI arguments, loads configuration, determines which checks to run, orchestrates the execution, and collates results. It will sequentially (or in some cases, concurrently where safe) run each category's check.
- **Check Modules:** Each category (Compilation, Linting, etc.) is a module:
  - Likely we'll have a base AbstractCheck class or simply a function signature that all follow. Each module can live in its own file (checks/compile.js, checks/lint.js, etc.).
  - They produce a result object defined by an interface (with fields like passed, score, details, etc. matching the JSON schema).
- **Integration with Tools:** Within each check module, we integrate with external tools or libraries:
  - Compilation uses the TypeScript compiler API or spawns tsc as a child process with --noEmit and --strict.
  - Linting uses ESLint's Node API (for performance, we can invoke ESLint programmatically on the project files and get a report object) and Prettier's API (prettier.check on files).
  - Testing might spawn npm test or leverage Jest's JS API (require('jest') programmatically with config). To collect coverage, we might use Jest's built-in coverage reporting. If using Vitest, possibly spawn vitest run --coverage. We have to handle whichever is present. (If both present, perhaps default to Jest or allow specifying.)
  - Schema validation may start the app or use Node's import to bring in server modules. Possibly we might need to spawn the server on a random port for OpenAPI testing. (We'll implement a simple HTTP call if OpenAPI spec is present and server can start – using something like Supertest to hit endpoints.)
  - Runtime checks might be custom code where we inject small test routines. For watchers, we could import the module that sets up watchers and simulate events by writing files. For concurrency, possibly reuse the test framework by adding some dynamic tests or simply write a temporary test file that does parallel calls (Jest can run a dynamic test file we create).
  - LLM integration can call an API (OpenAI) using an SDK or HTTP client, or invoke a local model via an API (for example, if using Ollama or another local inference server for Code Llama). We'll design it such that the LLM details are abstracted (the module will either read config for how to call the model, and then do it). Because LLM calls can be slow, the implementation might stream or show a spinner.
- **Result Aggregator:** After all checks, the main module collects each result and forms the overall summary (calculating total score etc.). This is straightforward given the results from each module.
- **Reporting Component:** Formatting the result to JSON or text. Possibly we'll have a small utility that given the result object, prints the console summary and/or writes JSON. This separation allows easily adding new output formats (for example, if we later want an HTML report, we could generate one).
- **Error Handling & Isolation:** Each check will be run in a way that if it throws an exception or encounters a fatal error, it doesn't crash the whole tool. The main orchestrator will catch errors per check, log them, and could either abort (if it's a core step like compile that failed in an unexpected way) or continue to the next step. For instance, if the test runner itself crashes, we handle that gracefully, report that tests couldn't complete, and perhaps skip dependent steps like coverage.

### 9.2 Implementation Plan (Phases)

We will implement the system in incremental phases:

#### Phase 1: Core Framework and Basic Checks – Timeline: Week 1-2
Set up the CLI structure and implement the fundamental checks:

- CLI argument parsing and config loading.
- Compilation check: Get this working first, as it's straightforward (invoke tsc, collect errors).
- Linting check: Integrate ESLint and Prettier. Ensure we can output counts of issues.
- Build the JSON report structure and verify that these two checks populate it correctly. Test on a sample project (intentionally create a TS error and a lint error to see output).
- At this stage, focus on correctness of running tools and collecting output.

#### Phase 2: Testing and Coverage – Timeline: Week 3
Integrate test running:

- Decide on approach for invoking tests. Likely use Jest's API if possible for speed, falling back to CLI. If using CLI, parse its output or use the JSON report it can generate (Jest can output results in JSON).
- Collect coverage data. Possibly rely on Jest's coverageSummary.json output for easy parsing.
- Compute pass/fail and scoring from test results.
- This phase will involve dealing with various test setups (some projects might not have any tests – ensure the tool handles "no tests" scenario by failing the category with 0% coverage).

#### Phase 3: Schema and Runtime Checks – Timeline: Week 4
These are more advanced:

- **Schema Validation:** Implement logic to detect Zod or OpenAPI usage. This might involve parsing files for Zod schemas. For OpenAPI, parse the YAML/JSON (perhaps use an existing library to load it). If an OpenAPI spec is present, consider using a library like openapi-validator or generating Zod schemas from it to use in tests. Implement a simple server invocation if needed – perhaps use Node's dynamic import to get the Express app and use Supertest to make calls.
- **Runtime (Watch/Race):** Implement static detection for watchers (regex search for fs.watch etc.). If found, write a small function to test it:
  - Possibly use the Node worker_threads or child_process to run the file watcher code in isolation (so we can terminate it after test). Or if the watcher is tied to the whole app, maybe start the app and then create a file event.
  - Implement concurrency tests by writing a temp Jest test file that runs some functions in parallel, or by programmatically doing so in our code. Also use Jest's ability to run tests in parallel to check for flakiness (we can run jest twice: once normally, once with -w 2 for example to see if any fail).
  - These checks are quite involved; we may prioritize the watcher test first (since that's simpler), and basic concurrency (like run tests twice and see if any fail randomly).

#### Phase 4: LLM Integration – Timeline: Week 5
Add the optional LLM review:

- Provide a mechanism to configure model (OpenAI vs local). Initially, we can integrate with OpenAI API (if key provided) for simplicity. Later, consider local models.
- Develop a prompt strategy. We might need to summarize the project because we cannot feed huge code directly. Possibly take the README + list of files + any file over X lines we summarize or snippet.
- Parse and format the LLM's response into our report. Ensure that if the LLM call fails (network issue or no key), it doesn't break the whole tool – just skip with a warning.
- This phase might also include user testing to refine what kind of feedback is useful.

#### Phase 5: Polish and Extensibility – Timeline: Week 6

- Write documentation for the tool (how to use, what each check means).
- Fine-tune scoring weights if needed after trying on real projects.
- Ensure configuration file support (allow a user to override any default settings by providing an aiqtest.config.json in the project).
- Add any remaining niceties: e.g., color output, better error messages, etc.
- Prepare for publishing (versioning, etc.).

Throughout implementation, we will continuously test the tool on various example projects, including intentionally flawed ones (to see if it catches issues) and clean ones (to ensure it doesn't give false positives). For instance, create a dummy project with one TypeScript error, one lint issue, etc., and ensure the output JSON reflects these.

### 9.3 Risks & Mitigations

- **Some checks (like running tests or spinning up a server) carry the risk of executing untrusted code.** To mitigate, we might run them in a separate process and possibly with restricted permissions. For example, run tests with a NODE_ENV that is test and maybe a flag to prevent dangerous operations (though not foolproof). In documentation, we'll note that running the tool on untrusted code has inherent risks (similar to running npm test on unknown code).
- **LLM cost and speed:** If using an API, it could slow the tool and incur cost. That's why it's optional. We may implement a cap on how much content we send (to avoid huge prompts).
- **Ensuring cross-platform compatibility:** we will test on Windows as well (especially path handling and spawning).
- **Tool version compatibility:** If a project uses a different version of TypeScript, our tool's tsc might highlight issues that their version doesn't, or vice versa. As a policy, using our bundled TS and ESLint is simplest. We'll document the versions we use, and possibly allow an override to use the project's local versions if desired.

In summary, implementation is broken down to deliver a functional tool quickly (by focusing on core checks first), then layering on the more complex and optional features. This ensures that even if the advanced parts take longer, the basic utility (compile/lint/test checks) is available and usable early.

---

## 10. Roadmap and Future Enhancements

Beyond the initial release, we envision several enhancements and extensions to increase the utility of the local testing system:

### 10.1 Security Scanning
Integrate security-focused checks. For example, run npm audit on the project's dependencies to flag known vulnerabilities, or use static analysis to detect common security mistakes (like usage of eval, or hardcoded secrets). This could become another category ("Security") in the report. Tools like SonarQube or ESLint plugins can detect some security code smells as well. This would help ensure AI-generated code hasn't unknowingly introduced security holes.

### 10.2 Performance and Complexity Metrics
Analyze code complexity (e.g., cyclomatic complexity) and performance hotspots. A future version might measure function sizes or use a tool to simulate load on an API to see performance characteristics. We could incorporate metrics like build size for front-end bundles or memory usage for certain tasks.

### 10.3 Support for Other Languages/Frameworks
Adapt the system for other project types:

- Python projects (using mypy for type checking, flake8/black for linting/formatting, pytest for tests, etc.).
- Java or C# projects (using their compilers and linters).
- Even multi-language polyglot repos. The extensible design is aimed at this; in the future, we might release language-specific variants or one tool that can detect the project type and run appropriate checks.

### 10.4 IDE Integration
Provide an option to run this tool from within IDEs or as a VS Code extension. For instance, a VS Code extension could execute aiqtest on demand and present results in the Problems pane. Real-time feedback could greatly help developers using AI code suggestions to immediately see quality issues. This is more of a distribution of the same functionality in a developer-friendly way.

### 10.5 Continuous Integration Mode
Although the goal is local, some users might still want to use it in CI environments (like a GitHub Action) as a sanity check on AI-generated pull requests. We could provide an official GitHub Action or CI script template that runs aiqtest and fails the build if critical issues are found. Essentially, turning the JSON report into a CI report (maybe even annotating pull requests with the findings).

### 10.6 Enhanced LLM Usage
Leverage AI not just for review but also for auto-fixing or improving the code:

- For example, if the LLM identifies a code smell or a potential bug, future versions could offer a "apply fixes" mode where the AI suggests a patch (somewhat experimental, but tools are moving in that direction).
- Use AI to generate additional tests for areas with low coverage. An idea: if coverage is below threshold, automatically prompt an AI to write a few unit tests for uncovered functions (there are research and tools in this area).
- Incorporate multiple AI models: maybe a cheaper model for quick review and a more powerful one for deep analysis.
- Keep an eye on "self-healing tests" or AI-driven test maintenance – perhaps integrate with such tools if they mature.

### 10.7 User-defined Quality Gates
Make it easy to configure custom rules for passing. For instance, a team might say "we want at least 90% coverage and no medium or high lint issues for a merge". In future, a simple config could allow toggling which categories must pass for overall pass and adjusting severity. This could be paired with a mode to break the build or not.

### 10.8 Reporting Enhancements

- A nicer HTML or Markdown report generation for easier reading and sharing. The JSON is good for automation, but a styled report (with charts for coverage, etc.) could be generated for human consumption.
- Trend analysis: if this tool is run repeatedly (e.g., nightly or on each commit), it could track metrics over time – we might build an option to save historical results and show trends (like coverage going up or down, number of lint issues decreasing, etc.).

### 10.9 Better Runtime Simulations
Extend the runtime behavior checks:

- Possibly integrate with tools like Aardwolf or others for detecting race conditions or using fuzz testing. For example, using a fuzzer to generate random sequences of API calls or file events to see if the app crashes.
- Include memory leak detection (run the app, perform operations, and see if memory usage grows abnormally).
- Thread concurrency if the Node app uses worker threads – ensure messages between threads are handled, etc.

### 10.10 Pluggable Actions on Failures
As an enhancement, allow the tool to automatically run certain commands if a category fails. E.g., if Prettier formatting fails, it could (with user permission) auto-run prettier --write to fix formatting. Or if tests fail, it could suggest running them in watch mode for debugging. These go beyond evaluation into remediation, which is a possible future direction to make it not just evaluative but interactive.

### 10.11 Community Rule Contributions
Since the tool will be used for AI-generated code, a community might form around common issues. We could allow users to contribute specific checks or patterns they've seen (for instance, "AI often forgets to handle promise rejections – here's a custom lint rule to catch that"). Incorporating these contributions can continuously improve the rule set.

Each of these enhancements would be considered in future versions after the initial product meets its core goals. The roadmap prioritizes features that add significant value for users (especially things that catch more bugs or make the tool easier to use) and aligns with the evolving landscape of AI-assisted development.

---

## 11. Suggested Tooling and Libraries

To implement the above functionality, we will leverage a variety of existing tools and libraries to avoid reinventing the wheel. Below is a summary of key technologies chosen for each part of the system and why:

### 11.1 TypeScript Compiler (tsc)
We will use the official TypeScript compiler to perform the strict compilation check. This can be done either by invoking the tsc CLI or using the TypeScript API (ts.createProgram) for more direct control. Using tsc in strict mode provides strong guarantees of catching type errors and potential bugs at compile time. It's the industry-standard way to ensure TypeScript code quality.

### 11.2 ESLint
For static code analysis. ESLint is a pluggable linter widely adopted in the JS/TS ecosystem. It can detect a range of issues from stylistic problems to actual bugs (like undefined variables). ESLint "helps you find and fix problems with your JavaScript code" and has an extensive set of rules and an active community. We will likely include the TypeScript ESLint plugin to lint TypeScript specifics. ESLint's Node API will be used to run the analysis and get results in JSON form.

### 11.3 Prettier
For code formatting enforcement. Prettier automatically formats code to a consistent style. It's essentially the de-facto formatter for JS/TS. As noted, Prettier is "made for keeping code formatting consistent" across a codebase. We'll use Prettier's API (prettier.format or prettier.check) to verify formatting and possibly list differences.

### 11.4 Jest or Vitest
For running tests and coverage. Jest is a popular test framework for Node/TS, with built-in coverage via Istanbul. Vitest is a modern alternative (especially in Vite projects) with similar capabilities. Our tool will autodetect which to use (perhaps favoring Jest if both are present). We'll use their CLIs or APIs to execute tests. For coverage, we rely on Istanbul (nyc) under the hood (since Jest uses Istanbul) to instrument and report coverage. Using these existing test frameworks ensures we respect the project's own testing setup and avoid duplicating test running logic. High coverage is beneficial because "high test coverage ensures that more of your code has been tested, reducing the risk of undetected bugs".

### 11.5 OpenAPI & Zod Integration

- **OpenAPI:** We can use packages like swagger-parser to parse OpenAPI files, or openapi-client-validator to validate responses against an OpenAPI spec. Another approach is to generate a client or types from OpenAPI (using tools like openapi-typescript or zod-openapi as mentioned in the research). For example, zod-openapi can generate Zod schemas from an OpenAPI spec, which we can then use for validation.
- **Zod:** We will use Zod itself if schemas are present. Zod is a lightweight dependency and perfect for validating JS objects. We can import the project's Zod schemas (since they're in the code) and run .safeParse on actual outputs in tests. If the project doesn't include Zod, but has JSON Schema, we can use Ajv (Another JSON Schema Validator) to do similar validation.

### 11.6 HTTP Testing
If needed for dynamic validation, Supertest (for Express/Koa servers) or axios can be used to simulate requests to the running app.

### 11.7 Node fs and Path libraries
Built-in Node modules will be used to manipulate files (for creating temp files for watcher tests, scanning directories for files to lint, etc.). Also, Chokidar could be used in tests to simulate or intercept file system events if more control is needed.

### 11.8 Mocking and Virtual FS
For testing file-related behavior, we might use mock-fs or memfs during our tool's own tests, but in the product itself, we likely will perform real file writes for watcher simulation (to be as close to real environment as possible). Still, if needed, libraries like memfs can help simulate complex file system scenarios in-memory.

### 11.9 Concurrency Testing Tools
Aside from leveraging Jest's parallel execution, we might use Node's WorkerThreads or child_process to spawn multiple operations. There aren't widely used libraries specifically for race condition detection in Node (it's often manual), but our approach is to combine existing capabilities (parallel tests, repeated runs) as described.

### 11.10 LLM Integration

- For OpenAI GPT-4 or GPT-3.5, we'll use OpenAI's official API client for Node (openai npm package) to send code for review if an API key is provided.
- For local LLM like Code Llama, one approach is using Ollama or similar Docker-contained models. Alternatively, libraries like LangChain can interface with local models or we could call a model hosted on Hugging Face pipelines. Since Code Llama excels in understanding code and providing feedback, it's a strong candidate for local analysis. We may provide a guide for users to install a local model and point our tool to it.
- We will ensure the LLM is used safely: chunking code if needed (to avoid prompt size issues) and possibly sanitizing prompts.

### 11.11 Reporting
For JSON, we'll just use native JSON stringify. If we later do an HTML or other format, libraries like Handlebars or markdown generators could be used to format results, but that's future. For colored console output, we can use a library like chalk to print colored text (green PASS, red FAIL, etc.) to improve UX.

### 11.12 CLI Framework
We might use a Node CLI helper like Commander.js or Yargs to parse arguments and generate help text easily. Commander is straightforward for defining commands and options.

Using these proven tools and libraries will accelerate development and ensure reliability. We'll pin versions in our tool to avoid unexpected changes (but allow upgrading in future releases). The combination of compiler + linter + tester + schemas + LLM provides a comprehensive toolkit to evaluate code quality from multiple angles:

- The compiler and linter ensure basic code quality and adherence to best practices (as recommended, running code through linting and static analysis is key for AI code).
- The test execution and coverage ensure functionality is verified and encourage thorough testing.
- Schema validation ensures contract reliability for APIs.
- Watcher and concurrency checks target tricky runtime aspects often overlooked.
- The LLM review brings an intelligent overview, mimicking an experienced human reviewer's perspective.

Each of these tools has been chosen for being state-of-the-art in its domain, aligning with the goal of maintaining high code quality standards for AI-generated code.

## 12. Success Metrics and Validation
